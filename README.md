##### PS: I realize I have uploaded my .env file to my github repo history. This was a mistake when configuring my .gitignore file. I have requested a new API KEY from TMDB and the key that you now see in the .env history file should no longer be usable.

# Movie Library - ReactJS
##### Personal project to enhance my React skills. No state management library has been used (yet), so the data is stored in the browser. Will be updated as time goes on (new versions will be made with different technologies, ie: Redux, ...).

### Prerequisites

You need to create an API KEY in [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
Create an .env file on the root of the project and put your API key

```
REACT_APP_MOVIE_API_KEY=yourapikeyhere
```

## Project execution

in the terminal
#### `npm install`
#### `npm start`

## Built With

- [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
